# Fun with ROS 2

Robotics are fun and ROS 2 is a must.

In this presentation I present a way to start, 100 % Python and Jupyter based.

Use 

`docker-compose up ` to run the container.

Also, run 

`docker container exec -it --user ubuntu ros_fun_ros2_1 bash -i /home/ubuntu/run_jupyter.sh`

to start jupyter inside the container.

Access the virtual machine screen by navigating to 

[http://localhost:6080](http://localhost:6080)

access the jupyter notebooks by navigating to:

[http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) 

on your **host** machine. 

From there open [*fun_with_ROS_2.ipynb*](http://localhost:8888/fun_with_ROS_2.ipynb) to access the presentation and demos.
